        <li>Drain the beans and chickpeas and put them into the processor.</li>
        <li>Finely grate in the lemon zest, then add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, the harissa, allspice, flour and coriander stalks (reserving the leaves). Blitz until smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor if needed.</li>
        <li>Scrape out the mixture and use clean, wet hands to quickly divide and shape it into 8 patties about 1.5cm thick.</li>
        <li>Put 1 tablespoon of oil into the frying pan and add the falafels, turning when golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Rip the seeds and stalks out of the peppers and tear each one into bite-sized chunks. Trim and halve the spring onions, then put on the griddle pan with the peppers and a pinch of salt and pepper, turning when charred.</li>
        <li>Put the tomatoes, chilli and half the coriander leaves into the processor. Squash in the unpeeled garlic through a garlic crusher, squeeze in the lime juice, whiz until fine, then season to taste and pour into a serving dish.</li>
        <li>Pop the tortillas into the microwave (800W) for 45 seconds while you marble the chilli sauce into the cottage cheese.</li>
        <Li>Squeeze the juice of half the zested lemon over the charred veggies, then take with the falafels to the table, scattering everything with the rest of the coriander.</Li>
        <li>Let everyone assemble their own wraps, and serve with pickled red cabbage, if you like.</li>
